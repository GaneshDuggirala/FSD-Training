                        Reddy -
                        Chairman</b></h3>
                <p class="lh-lg">Dr. Kallam Anji Reddy was a well-known scientist, entrepreneur and philanthropist. An
                    erudite and
                    patriotic visionary, he set up Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories in 1984 to make affordable medicines and
                    worked to make Dr. Reddy’s a hub for research in pharmacy.

                    About a decade after setting up Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, he was encouraged by the possibilities of
                    helping others to also share and reap the benefits of India’s economic growth. He started the Dr.
                    Reddy’s Foundation in 1996, with the vision of assisting young disadvantaged persons to have access
                    to quality education and developing skills to keep pace with modern day challenges.

                    Dr. Anji Reddy received the Padma Shri in 2001 and later the Padma Bhushan for his contribution to
                    the Indian pharmaceutical industry.</p>
