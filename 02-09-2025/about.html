                        <h3>Dr. Kallam Anji Reddy - Founder (Dr. Reddy's Labs & Dr. Reddy's Foundation)</h3>
                    </div>
                    Dr. Kallam Anji Reddy was a well-known scientist, entrepreneur and philanthropist. An erudite and
                    patriotic visionary, he set up Dr. Reddyâ€™s Laboratories in 1984 to make affordable medicines and
                    worked to make Dr. Reddyâ€™s a hub for research in pharmacy.

                    About a decade after setting up Dr. Reddyâ€™s Laboratories, he was encouraged by the possibilities of
                    helping others to also share and reap the benefits of Indiaâ€™s economic growth. He started the Dr.
                    Reddyâ€™s Foundation in 1996, with the vision of assisting young disadvantaged persons to have access
                    to quality education and developing skills to keep pace with modern day challenges.

                    Dr. Anji Reddy received the Padma Shri in 2001 and later the Padma Bhushan for his contribution to
                    the Indian pharmaceutical industry.

        </fieldset>
        <p>At Dr. Reddyâ€™s Tech Jobs Skill Development Initiative, we believe that technology is a powerful equalizerâ€”a
            force that can uplift individuals, transform communities, and shape the future of the nation. Launched as
            part of Dr. Reddyâ€™s commitment to sustainable development and inclusive growth, this initiative is focused
            on empowering youth with the digital skills needed to succeed in the modern IT industry.

            India's digital economy is growing rapidly, but the demand for skilled professionals continues to outpace
            supply. Thousands of young graduates have the drive and potential but lack access to the right training,
            guidance, and industry exposure. Thatâ€™s where we come in.

            We offer specialized, hands-on training programs in Full Stack Development (FSD) and Data Science (DS)â€”two
            of the most sought-after domains in todayâ€™s tech landscape. Our programs are designed not just to teach code
            or concepts but to build well-rounded, job-ready professionals who can solve real-world problems, work
            collaboratively, and adapt to evolving technologies.

            By combining technical training with soft skills, mentorship, and career support, we ensure that every
            learner who comes through our doors leaves with the confidence, competence, and connections to build a
            successful tech career.

            story.

            We envision a world where no capable mind is left behind due to lack of opportunity, and where technology
            becomes a tool for empowerment, innovation, and positive societal change.
